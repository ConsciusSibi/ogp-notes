At this point, we have accumulated a nontrivial amount of code and documentation. It would be very unfortunate if at this point, by making some changes we accidentally messed up our program completely and would have to painfully reconstruct the previous version of the program by hand. To avoid this type of situations, it is very important to do proper source code version control. In this course, we use the popular industry-standard version control system called Git. Git makes it very easy to save snapshots (called _commits_) of your source code, to see the changes between the current version of your code and the most recently committed version, to see the changes between any two committed versions, and so on. It also makes it easy to avoid getting confused and accidentally losing work when you are working on the same codebase on different computers. Very importantly, it also makes it easy for teams of programmers to collaborate on the same program. In particular, it makes it easy to make sure that one programmer does not accidentally overwrite another programmer's changes, and to understand what changes were made by other programmers. It also helps with merging changes made to the same file at the same time by multiple programmers (although even when using version control systems, it is best to avoid this if possible).

Eclipse makes it easy to use Git to store your Eclipse projects.
